            <h2> How Did I Started Coding? </h2>
            <p> In my life, I did my first coding when I was in class 5. I started it by Scratch. At that time I was not at all intrested in coding. In scratch I created very few projects. After that in class 6, came a website known as <a href="https://www.code.org"> Code.org </a>. It was a very good website for starting coding but I was not intrested much in coding at that time. Then in class 6 only, after term 1 exams my teacher introduced us to HTML. Then also I didn't took it much seriously and just somehow did it. <img src="Images/hcoding.jpg"> Then in class 7 came <a href="https://python.org"> Python </a>. At that time python seemed to be very difficult for me. I learnt some things in python but forgot some of them. At last in class 9 when I came to Dehradun and changed my school, then in my new school I had to choose a Club, so I choosed IT Club. In IT Club the teachers taught us HTML. And then I made my intrest in coding and now I am here. Now I like coding very much. <a class="btn1 btn2" href="assets/projects.html"> My Projects </a> </p>
